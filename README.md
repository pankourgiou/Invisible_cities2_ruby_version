# Invisible_cities2_ruby_version
My original goal here, was to create a language, a programming language so that I can say a secret story. I combined Kaotican and ruby programming language so that I make a new one, a hybrid programming language I call this language Christina.
This is a remake of Italo Calvino's "Invisible cities" book, who I greatly respect and who I think is a great writer. On the issues folder there is an .odt file with the coded story writen "Tolkien style:)" in the hybrid language I created.
I have to mention I was too lucky I had all this help with Coldplay band inventing this language called Kaotican. One challenge someone has to overcome is the Will to read the second challenge is that we should use our imagination more and in a more creative fashion.
This isn't always easy, so on the issues folder there are pictures of what I perceive as "Invisible cities" as well as three video wiles from MeetDan website showing how a city will look like 100 years from now. I greatly respect all 
those artists and I advise you to support them too, they all worth it! Let's try to use our imagination more. Enjoy the reading!
